# Integration of AI frames (attachments) with content from KB.
KB has critical things such as pdf files , images (to be added soon), web links to blogs, code etc, doc files. Idea is that we can attach these to the AI frames . Not just whole doc but specific parts of it . For youtube video we already have this  where we can add start time and Duration we need same for different kinds of content .  This will make AI frames like an annotation engine.
We have 
1. PDF file : We should be able to link parts of this file from KB as attachment to Ai frames. Fot this current PDF attachment shows PDF URL it should also give an option to instead link existing KB content (drop down showing existing KB files with .pdf extension) How we can link part of the file is an open question . My ideas either via page number or a UI utility which open up pdf file on browser and allows user to draw a selectable area and tag it.


# pre Requisite : Remove Deepresearch from nav and home page and readme 

Our main focus now is on AI frames. before we do specs 006 I want
 \
remove DeepResearch RAG from top navbar .\
# Home Page \
Remove start research \
Everything You Need for AI Research--> Remove DeepResearch from 
here \
and from other places in home page .\
AI frames explain how AI frames is uselful as Annotation Engine, 
Learning Platform , deepresearch tool and Workflow manager \
\make sure user understands that AI frames is a deepresearch tool (
 so microscope symbol and deepresearch capabiliity needs to be 
highlighted) \
Also change readme file accordingly

actual code . Our plan is to incorporate deepresearch into ai 
frames itself later and deepresearch code will be useful to refer
