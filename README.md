# 🚀 TimeCapsuleSLM

### **Solving Open Learning with a Complete AI-Powered Platform for Research, Creativity, and Collaboration**

AI Frames bootstraps learning. It connects everything in one flow — data, ideas, video, notes, docs, PDFs — so you can go from prompt to structured learning paths instantly. Grounded by your Knowledge Base, AI builds and updates frames step‑by‑step with citations, quizzes, and mastery checks.

#### Why AI Frames
- Connect everything in one flow: video, PDFs, notes, and more
- Prompt → AI builds frames, chapters, and attachments
- Grounded by your KB (local-first VectorStore) with citations
- Vision or text-only modes; OpenRouter-first with Ollama fallback
- Accept/decline AI suggestions and iterate across turns
- Checkpoint quizzes, remediation, and pause/resume

## 🎯 **The Problem We're Solving**

In today's digital age, researchers, educators, and learners face several critical challenges:

### 🔍 **Research Fragmentation**

- Research findings scattered across multiple tools and platforms
- No unified way to capture, organize, and share research insights
- Difficulty in maintaining context across different research sessions

### 📚 **Learning Inefficiency**

- Traditional learning methods lack personalization and interactivity
- No seamless integration between video content, documents, and AI assistance
- Learning experiences are often linear and don't adapt to individual needs

### 🤖 **AI Integration Gaps**

- AI tools are isolated and don't work together cohesively
- Limited local AI capabilities for privacy-conscious users
- No unified platform for combining multiple AI models and services

### 🔐 **Privacy & Control**

- Dependence on cloud-based services that may compromise data privacy
- Limited control over personal research data and learning materials
- No offline-first approach for sensitive research work

### 🎓 **Educational Challenges**

- **Low-Resource Environments**: Teachers lack tools to create engaging content without expensive infrastructure
- **Teacher Workload**: Manual lesson planning and content organization is time-consuming
- **Student Engagement**: Traditional linear learning doesn't adapt to individual student needs
- **Offline Learning**: Limited access to internet connectivity in many educational settings
- **Collaboration Barriers**: Students and teachers struggle to collaborate effectively in remote or offline scenarios
