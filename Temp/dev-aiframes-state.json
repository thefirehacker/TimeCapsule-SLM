The fleet shows various builders: Usuki Iron Works, MES, Harima Shipbuilding, MHIN, TSX, and SDX. Different shipyards specialize in different vessel types and sizes. Japanese shipyards (Usuki, Harima) have long traditions, while modern abbreviations (TSX, SDX, MHIN) may represent international partnerships or modern shipyard groups. Shipyard selection affects: (1) Construction quality and standards, (2) Delivery timelines, (3) Cost efficiency, (4) Post-construction support. Fleet diversity across multiple builders indicates strategic sourcing and risk management.",
