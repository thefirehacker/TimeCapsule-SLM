The fleet shows speeds ranging from 12.5 kt (GYOKUKAI MARU) to 15.1 kt (TAIO MARU). Service speed is typically 85-90% of maximum speed, optimized for fuel efficiency. Higher speeds enable: (1) Faster transit times, (2) More voyages per year, (3) Better schedule reliability. However, higher speeds increase fuel consumption exponentially. Modern vessels balance speed with fuel efficiency - newer ships (14.0-14.6 kt) show optimized performance compared to older designs (12.5-13.1 kt).",
