 [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree.

 -------------- RxDB dev-mode warning -------------------------------
you are seeing this because you use the RxDB dev-mode plugin https://rxdb.info/dev-mode.html?console=dev-mode 
This is great in development mode, because it will run many checks to ensure
that you use RxDB correct. If you see this in production mode,
you did something wrong because the dev-mode plugin will decrease the performance.

🤗 Hint: To get the most out of RxDB, check out the Premium Plugins
to get access to faster storages and more professional features: https://rxdb.info/premium/?console=dev-mode 

You can disable this warning by calling disableWarnings() from the dev-mode plugin.

 -------------- RxDB Open Core RxStorage -------------------------------
You are using the free Dexie.js based RxStorage implementation from RxDB https://rxdb.info/rx-storage-dexie.html?console=dexie 
While this is a great option, we want to let you know that there are faster storage solutions available in our premium plugins.
For professional users and production environments, we highly recommend considering these premium options to enhance performance and reliability.
 https://rxdb.info/premium/?console=dexie 
If you already purchased premium access you can disable this log by calling the setPremiumFlag() function from rxdb-premium/plugins/shared.

 [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree.

 -------------- RxDB dev-mode warning -------------------------------
you are seeing this because you use the RxDB dev-mode plugin https://rxdb.info/dev-mode.html?console=dev-mode 
This is great in development mode, because it will run many checks to ensure
that you use RxDB correct. If you see this in production mode,
you did something wrong because the dev-mode plugin will decrease the performance.

🤗 Hint: To get the most out of RxDB, check out the Premium Plugins
to get access to faster storages and more professional features: https://rxdb.info/premium/?console=dev-mode 

You can disable this warning by calling disableWarnings() from the dev-mode plugin.

 -------------- RxDB Open Core RxStorage -------------------------------
You are using the free Dexie.js based RxStorage implementation from RxDB https://rxdb.info/rx-storage-dexie.html?console=dexie 
While this is a great option, we want to let you know that there are faster storage solutions available in our premium plugins.
For professional users and production environments, we highly recommend considering these premium options to enhance performance and reliability.
 https://rxdb.info/premium/?console=dexie 
If you already purchased premium access you can disable this log by calling the setPremiumFlag() function from rxdb-premium/plugins/shared.

 -------------- RxDB dev-mode warning -------------------------------
you are seeing this because you use the RxDB dev-mode plugin https://rxdb.info/dev-mode.html?console=dev-mode 
This is great in development mode, because it will run many checks to ensure
that you use RxDB correct. If you see this in production mode,
you did something wrong because the dev-mode plugin will decrease the performance.

🤗 Hint: To get the most out of RxDB, check out the Premium Plugins
to get access to faster storages and more professional features: https://rxdb.info/premium/?console=dev-mode 

You can disable this warning by calling disableWarnings() from the dev-mode plugin.

 -------------- RxDB Open Core RxStorage -------------------------------
You are using the free Dexie.js based RxStorage implementation from RxDB https://rxdb.info/rx-storage-dexie.html?console=dexie 
While this is a great option, we want to let you know that there are faster storage solutions available in our premium plugins.
For professional users and production environments, we highly recommend considering these premium options to enhance performance and reliability.
 https://rxdb.info/premium/?console=dexie 
If you already purchased premium access you can disable this log by calling the setPremiumFlag() function from rxdb-premium/plugins/shared.
